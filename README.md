# DynamicsFscmPackageImport

Solution has only generic package file generation logic. A sample package template is added as an example. 
Package templates can be stored in a blob container with DmfProjectName.zip file name so you don't have to remember(configure) the template file names.
  
Run the function app project on your local and go to http://localhost:7071/api/GenerateDataPackage using a browser to download the updated package file
